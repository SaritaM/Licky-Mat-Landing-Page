            <h1>Canine Enrichment</h1>
            <p>Providing enrichment for your dog is one of the most important aspects of pet care and it's easy to incorporate into day-to-day life.</p>
            <p>Enrichment improves and enhances your dog's mental state using a range of activities designed to challenge and exercise their brains. These activities encourage your dog to problem solve, learn new skills and become more confident.</p>
            <p>Enriching your dog's life is simpler than you might think, and it doesn't require a large budget or huge time commitment. Here's a list of enrichment activities you may have heard of before:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food Tube Dog Puzzle:</strong> All you need for this puzzle is toilet paper or paper towel rolls with a box (preferably a shoe box) to arrange them in. Throw your treats inside the holes and watch your dog get to work! You can increase the difficult of this exercise by adding paper to each paper towel hole. </li>
                <li><strong>Muffin Tin Dog Puzzle:</strong> This is a fun, simple one! Grab a muffin tin, some treats and tennis balls. You'll want to put the treats in each muffin holder and cover them with tennis balls. </li>
                <li><strong>Rolled Up Treat Burrito Towel:</strong> All you need for this game is a towel and some treats! Lay your towel flat on the ground, toss a few treats in, roll the towel over and repeat the process. You can shape the towel into a burrito or however you find most fitting!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Licking Mats</h4>
            <p>Licking mats are a great budget-friendly, time-saving activity for our bestfriends! Simply grab your pups favorite peanut butter, spread some on our mats and toss it into the freezer for 2 hours! The Darth Vader Licky Mat, a summertime favorite, also comes with a wide variety of benefits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduces anxiety, boredom and destructive behavior!</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mentally stimulating, induces problem solving and thinking.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>A fun activity for your pup with a unique method of enjoying treats.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>15 mins of canine enrichment is equivalent to a 45 minute walk.</strong></li>
            </ul>
